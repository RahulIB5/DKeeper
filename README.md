# DKeeper - A Decentralized Keeper App  

## Overview  
DKeeper is a decentralized note-keeping application built with a **Motoko** backend and a **React** frontend. It leverages the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)** to ensure secure and decentralized data storage.  

## Features  
- **Decentralized storage** powered by ICP  
- **Secure and scalable** backend using Motoko  
- **Modern and responsive** UI built with React  

## Challenge  
Hosting the Motoko backend on the **ICP network** could't be done due to the requirement of **ICP tokens**, as free deployment options are limited.
