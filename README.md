# DKeeper - A Decentralized Keeper App  

## Overview  
DKeeper is a decentralized note-keeping application built with a **Motoko** backend and a **React** frontend. It leverages the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)** to ensure secure and decentralized data storage.  

## Features  
- **Decentralized storage** powered by [ICP](https://internetcomputer.org/)  
- **Secure and scalable** backend using [Motoko](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko-introduction)  
- **Modern and responsive** UI built with React  

## Challenge  
Hosting the Motoko backend on the **ICP network** could't be done due to the requirement of **ICP tokens**, as free deployment options are limited.
